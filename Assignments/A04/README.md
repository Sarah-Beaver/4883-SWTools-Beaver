This project queried a database to show how much easier it is to get answers and how much faster then cycling through so many json files.

Download both index and config. Replace the stars in the config file with proper database credentials. Then run the index.php. It is setup to show answers in a browser. If anyproblems make sure both files are on the server that the database is on.
